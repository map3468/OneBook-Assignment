            Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable Future
          </h2>
          <p>
            The OneBook for 2009-2010 is Deep Economy: The Wealth of Communities
            and Our Du- rable Future (2007) by one of the greatest environmental
            writers and activists in the U.S., Bill McKibben. In Deep Economy,
            you will read about how our globalized economy has become addicted
            to the ideas of limitless economic growth and endless consumption of
            goods. As McKibben defines it, a deep economy “cares less about
            quantity than quality [and] takes as its goal the production of
            human satisfaction as much as surplus material.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Deep Economy asserts that what we eat, what we drive, where we live
            and what we feel are all related to how we use or misuse the earth’s
            resources. This provocative book will make you think about how you
            live your life every day and will challenge you to dream of a better
            future.
