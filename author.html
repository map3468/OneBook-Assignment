            The UT Arlington OneBook program is delighted to be hosting a visit
            to campus by Bill McKibben, the author of this year’s OneBook, Deep
            Economy: The Wealth of Communities and Our Durable Future (2007).
            McKibben is possibly the most prolific, important and influential
            environmental writer of our time.
          </p>
          <p>
            His first book, The End of Nature (1989), was a pioneering work of
            journalism on climate change that was hailed by reviewers as a
            compelling, must-read about the future of our planet. Subsequent
            books, such as Hope, Human and Wild: True Stories of Living Lightly
            on the Earth (1995), Maybe One: A Case for Smaller Families (1998)
            and Enough: Staying Human in an Engineered Age (2003) explore
            sustainability, population growth and the perils of technology and
            genetic engineering.
          </p>
          <p>
            McKibben’s great stature and contribution to American environmental
            writing is evidenced by the recent publication of a retrospective
            collection of his essays titled The Bill McKibben Reader (2008).
            Bill McKibben is more than just writer, though; he has been a
            tireless environmental activist. He has led two of the largest
            protests against global warming in U.S. history, one in 2006 and the
            other in 2007.
          </p>
          <p>
            McKibben also founded Stepitup07.org, a website designed to help
            pressure the U.S. government toward more sustainable policies on
            carbon emissions. After reading and discussing Deep Economy, join us
            to meet its accomplished and fascinating author!
