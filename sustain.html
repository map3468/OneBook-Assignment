          <h2>Sustainability</h2>
          <p>
            The OneBook theme for 2009-2010 is the central theme of Deep
            Economy: Sustainability. Sustainability is the concept of using
            resources (such as fossil fuels or water) without depleting or
            wasting them. Sustainability is about maintaining life and society
            through technologies, policies and personal choices that help us use
            our planetâ€™s limited resources more effectively.
          </p>
          <p>
            The concept of Sustainability encompasses several overlapping
            domains that we will explore in this study guide, our multi-media
            resources and many presentations and activities on campus. We have
            prepared several icons to designate these domains, and to publicize
            on-campus events that you will find helpful as you study the topic
            of Sustainability.

              Our economic system drives the production, transport and sale of
              goods, whether they be laptops, shoes or packaged candy. These
              goods, as delivered to us as consumers by our globalized economy,
              are directly related to energy and the environment. To lead a more
              sustainable life, economies will have to adapt to new paradigms
              and we will have to change how we purchase and consume goods.

              How will we acquire and maintain the energy needed to fuel the
              production and movement of goods, and to power our homes and
              communities? Wise, efficient energy usage is key to
              sustainability, as is the search and development of alternate
              sources of energy such as biofuels, wind and solar power.

              It may not be obvious at first sight, but unsustainable living
              affects how we interact with one another. For example, our
              dependence on oil has resulted in vast metropolitan areas with few
              places for individuals to gather and meet each other, and in
              solitary car commutes. A more sustainable lifestyle holds the
              promise of building and maintaining closer-knit communities.

              Everything we do as residents on this planet impacts the
              environment. The environment includes natural resources like
              water, oil, forests, plants and animals. The choices we make today
              will affect our environment and its ability to sustain our
              survival on planet Earth.
